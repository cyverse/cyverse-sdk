Tutorial: Getting Started with CyVerse SDK
-------
The following instructions will guide you through setting up Agave-based access to two TACC HPC systems and a private storage system powered by TACC's global file system. 

A "system" under [Agave API v2](https://www.agaveapi.co/) is a combination of login credentials, information about available physical resources, policy descriptions, and configuration options that combine to create an abstraction of a physical computing system. This frees end users from needing to know specific details about the actual computing environment in order to move data to the system and run computing tasks on it.
