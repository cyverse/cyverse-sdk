## Using the Agave CLI within the CyVerse Cyberinfrastructure

[CyVerse](http://www.cyverse.org/) is a federally funded, multi-site organization with the mission to design, deploy, and expand a national cyberinfrastructure for life sciences research.
This cyberinfrastructure includes data storage facilities, a cloud infrastructure for high performance computing, authentication and security services, and education and training resources.
CyVerse grants access to that cyberinfrastructure through multiple application programming interfaces (APIs) and web portals.
One such method of access is via the [Agave](http://agaveapi.co/) command line interface (CLI).

The objective of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to effectively use the Agave CLI to take advantage of the CyVerse cyberinfrastructure.
It is divided into two parts:

__Part 1: Basic Principles__
* [Intial Assumptions](docs/initial_assumptions.md)
* [Installing the Agave CLI](docs/installing_agave.md)
* [Initializing with CyVerse](docs/initializing.md)
* [Managing Data](docs/managing_data.md)
* [Searching for an Application](docs/searching_apps.md)
* [Creating and Submitting a Job](docs/creating_submitting_jobs.md)

__Part 2: Intermediate CLI__
* [Assumptions So Far](docs/assumptions_so_far.md)
* [Importing Data from Other Systems or the Web](docs/importing_data.md)
* [Sharing Data with Other Users](docs/sharing_data.md)
* [Using Monitors to Track System Health](docs/using_monitors.md)
* [Managing Identities](docs/managing_identities.md)
* [Automating Workflows](docs/automating_workflows.md)

__Part 3: Helpful Tools__
* [Postit Helper](docs/postit_helper.md)
