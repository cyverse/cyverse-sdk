Initial Assumptions
===============================================

Before getting started with CyVerse SDK, we assume the following:
* You have a [CyVerse account](https://user.cyverse.org/register/)
* You have a [TACC user account](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu)
* You are a member of a [TACC](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu) project with an active allocation to use [TACC systems](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides), that is, either:
  * You have your own TACC project allocation (e.g. through [XSEDE](https://portal.xsede.org/allocations-overview)) _or_
  * You are developing a public CyVerse application and thus have access to the iPlant-Collabs project allocation (to request access to this allocation, join the [Agave Platform on Slack](https://slackin.agaveapi.co) and message John Fonner)

* You can successully login to TACC's [Stampede](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides/stampede) and/or [Lonestar5](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides/lonestar5) HPC systems
* You are comfortable [editing text files](https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/v2.7/nano.html) and [working at the command line](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#Introduction)

Any questions?  Join the [Agave Platform on Slack](https://slackin.agaveapi.co) and ask away.
